  "body": " Course Content and Format   Course Description  This course will provide students with an understanding of how organizations can successfully collect, organize, manipulate, use, prospect and present data. Students will manipulate and interpret actual data using software such as Excel, SPSS, Power BI, Tableau, or Watson.   Prerequisite Information:   Successful completion of QUAN 2020 and Junior standing in the College of Business are required. You are expected to be proficient in Excel – do not expect class time to be devoted to learning Excel basics.    Course Format  The course will be online, and a tentative schedule is included later in the syllabus. On Canvas, the course is organized by weekly modules.  Based on a background coverage of Descriptive Statistics, Data Visualization, Probability, Statistical Inference, and the philosophy of information presentation, we will use Excel and Tableau to produce data analysis of real-world data samples.  This class may be run more informally than what you might have experienced in QUAN 2010 and 2020. You are now more experienced and mature learners, and our course will focus mostly on projects\/case studies\/quizzes\/homework instead of exams. You should do the assigned reading from the schedule below each week.    Course Learning Objectives     Students will understand the principles and concepts of descriptive statistics in a business context, extending the coverage in QUAN 2010 and QUAN 2020.    Students will develop a philosophy of information presentation, and apply the concepts of descriptive statistics to make effective data displays to support decision making.    Students will apply descriptive analytics tools and software to uncover patterns and relationships in data.    Students will summarize and communicate insights provided by data in a professional business context.      "

I strongly recommend asking me for extensions if you find yourself needing them. In general, communicating with me earlier rather than later about your situation makes it more likely that we can make some kind of arrangement appropriate to your situation. Let me know as soon as possible if you are going to miss an assignment. If you don't notify me in advance, or if you do not have a valid excuse, you may not be allowed to make up the assignment\/assessment, and you may receive a score of zero for that assignment\/assessment.

However, specific classroom attendance policies are left to the discretion of the instructors. Students are responsible for knowing the attendance policies of their individual instructors. Business instructors may drop students who do not attend the first class of the semester. This policy allows waitlisted students who do attend the first class to be added to the class. Students registering for classes after the first class must obtain approval from the instructor prior to enrolling in the class.  Class attendance is an important part of the educational process in this course. Our class time is valuable, and you’re expected to attend class regularly if you are able (and not sick). Talk to me if you have concerns about this.  The material builds on itself, so I really don’t want you to fall behind. If something comes up, such as illness, that prevents you from attending class, then let me know as soon as possible.

Moreover, in this classroom we will be working in groups for some of the time. It is essential that we all work together to create an environment where everyone is welcome.  In this class, we will work together to develop a learning community that is inclusive and respectful. Our diversity may be reflected by differences in race, culture, age, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic background, and myriad other social identities and life experiences. The goal of inclusiveness, in a diverse community, encourages and appreciates expressions of different ideas, opinions, and beliefs, so that conversations and interactions that could potentially be divisive turn instead into opportunities for intellectual and personal enrichment. A dedication to inclusiveness requires respecting what others say, their right to say it, and the thoughtful consideration of others' communication. Both speaking up and listening are valuable tools for furthering thoughtful, enlightening dialogue. Respecting one another's individual differences is critical in transforming a collection of diverse individuals into an inclusive, collaborative and excellent learning community. Our core commitment shapes our core expectation for behavior inside and outside of the classroom.  "

I will work with you and university counsel’s office to ensure a reasonable accommodation is made.    Military and Veteran Students  Military students who have the potential to participate in military activities including training and deployment should consult with faculty prior to registration for any course, but no later than the end of the first week of classes. For more information, visit the Office of Veteran and Military Student Affairs .  At this time, the student should provide the instructor with a schedule of planned absences, preferably signed by the student's commander, to allow the instructor to evaluate and advise the student on the possible impact of the absences. In this course, the instructor will consider absences due to participation in verified military activities to be excused absences, on par with those due to other unavoidable circumstances such as illness. If, however, it appears that military obligations will prevent adequate attendance or performance in the course, the instructor may advise the student to register for the course at another time, when they are more likely to be successful.

Follow the advice and directions provided in the email.    Meet with your instructor, academic advisor, or other student support team member as soon as possible.       UCCS Student Code of Conduct and Professionalism  The purpose of the Student Code of Conduct is to maintain the general welfare of the university community. The university strives to make the campus community a place of study, work, and residence where people are treated, and treat one another, with respect and civility. This course covers material that could generate strong opinions or emotions. Consider the Daniels Fund Ethics Initiative Principles: Integrity, Trust, Accountability, Transparency, Fairness, Respect, Rule of Law, and Viability, when considering conduct during the course. Learn more at the Daniels Fund Ethics Initiative at UCCS website .    Academic Integrity and Plagiarism  The College of Business follows and enforces the student conduct rules and policies that are set forth by the university and are listed in the Student Rights and Responsibilities section of the Academic Catalog.  Students caught engaging in academic dishonesty may receive a zero on the assignment in question, an \"F\" in the class, or be suspended from the College of Business and\/or university. This includes, but is not limited to, plagiarism (copying others’ work as your own—in part or in total—without the proper citations) and\/or the use of artificial intelligence to write or contribute to assignments without instructor approval.    Generative AI  Given that anything generated by AI has been culled from the web and restated or recreated without attribution (and sometimes even with false attribution), that content could be considered as to have been plagiarized.   Always be sure to include a citation when you use AI on an assignment.   The use of generative AI tools is permitted in this course for the following activities:   Brainstorming and refining your ideas    Fine tuning your research questions    Finding information on your topic    Drafting an outline to organize your thoughts    Checking grammar and style     The use of generative AI tools is not permitted in this course for the following activities:   Impersonating you in classroom contexts, such as by using the tool to compose discussion board replies or content that you put into a Teams or Zoom chat    Completing group work that your group has assigned to you, unless it is mutually agreed upon that you may utilize the tool    Writing a draft of a writing assignment    Writing entire sentences, paragraphs, or papers to complete class assignments       Copyright Statement  Unless otherwise noted, all materials contained in this course, including slide and video presentations, exams, study guides, outlines, and similar materials, are protected by copyright laws and university policy.  You may download and\/or make copies of course materials for personal use only. You may not reproduce, distribute, upload, display, or share any course materials, in whole or in part, without my express written consent. Unauthorized distribution of these materials to any website, either during or after the semester, is strictly prohibited.    Privacy Statement  Assuring privacy among faculty and students engaged in online and face-to-face instructional activities helps promote open and robust conversations and mitigates concerns that comments made within the context of the class will be shared beyond the classroom. As such, recordings of instructional activities occurring in online or face-to-face classes may be used solely for internal class purposes by the faculty member and students registered for the course, and only during the period in which the course is offered. Students will be informed of such recordings by a statement in the syllabus for the course in which they will be recorded. Instructors who wish to make subsequent use of recordings that include student activity may do so only with informed written consent of the students involved or if all student activity is removed from the recording. Recordings including student activity that have been initiated by the instructor may be retained by the instructor only for individual use.    Responsible Reporting: Institutional Equity\/Title IX Statement  The Office of Institutional Equity (OIE), administers the University of Colorado (CU) Sexual Misconduct policy (including Title IX), the UCCS Discrimination and Harassment Policy, and the CU Conflict of Interest in Cases of Amorous Relationships Policy. All UCCS faculty and staff, including student employees, are considered “responsible employees” and must report any suspected or known conduct that may be in violation of these policies (“prohibited conduct”) directly to the OIE. This reporting requirement exists to support the safety of our campus community, and there is no statute of limitations. Prohibited conduct includes unwanted verbal or physical conduct that is sexual in nature, or based on a protected class (such as, gender, race, veteran status, disability, etc.). You may review the Applicable Policies and OIE's Resolution Procedures here . While reporting prohibited conduct to the OIE is required by UCCS employees, participation in an OIE resolution process through the OIE is voluntary. Confidential reporting, and access to medical and mental health services, are available to students through the UCCS Wellness Center at 719-255-4444.    Diversity Statement  UCCS considers the diversity of its students, faculty, and staff to be a strength and critical to its educational mission. UCCS expects every member of the university community to contribute to an inclusive and respectful culture for all in its classrooms, work environments, and at campus events.

What if we want to see only Nissan data? (Filter.)     Top Cars Continued ( Continued) Look at the file Top20Cars2019 again:  Highlight Feb 2019 sales that are between 10,000 and 20,000.  Soft Drinks Open the file SoftDrinks in Excel:    If we make a frequency distribution, what should the bins be?    Create a frequency distribution in Excel.     Soft Drinks Continued ( Continued) Open the file SoftDrinks again in Excel:  Construct a percent frequency distribution in Excel.  Audit Time Open the file AuditTime .  (This shows the number of days to complete audits for 20 different customers.) We are going to construct a frequency distribution for this data.  Audit Time Continued Open the file AuditTime again:  Use the frequency distribution we found above to construct a histogram for this data. Then determine if the distribution is skewed left, skewed right, or symmetric.  Audit Time Continued Open the file ``AuditTime\" again.  Use the frequency distribution we found above to construct the cumulative frequency distribution for this data.  Home Sales Open the file HomeSales in Excel: This file shows a sample of home selling prices for 12 homes in a suburb of Cincinnati, Ohio. Use Excel to find the mean (average), median, and mode(s) for the home sale values.  Mutual Fund Returns Open the file MutualFundReturns in Excel:  Assume we invest in the fund.   What would the balance in the fund at the end of year 1 be?    What about the balance at the end of year 2?    What would the balance be at the end of 10 years?     Home Sales Continued Open the file HomeSales again in Excel:  Calculate the following quantities:   Range of home sale prices    The sample variance, for the 12 given home sale prices    The sample standard deviation, , for the 12 given home sale prices    The coefficient of variation for the home sales data     Home Sales Continued (Percentiles) Open the file HomeSales again in Excel:    Sort the sale prices in ascending order.    Find the sale price that would be the 50th percentile using Excel.    Find what percentile the sale price of would be.    Home Sales (Continued) Percentile Location Open the file HomeSales again in Excel:  Find the location of the th percentile, using this formula. Does this make sense with your previous answer(s)?  Home Sales Continued (Quartiles) Open the file HomeSales again in Excel:  Find , , and for home sales prices.  -score meaning What does a -score (or -value) of -1.5 mean?  that is 1.5 standard deviations below the mean of the data set   Home Sales (Continued) -scores Find the -values for the home sales prices in the Excel file.   Tablets Sold A group of electronics stores wants to better understand how well a certain tablet is selling at their stores. Below is the number of those tables each store sold in a given day: Find the IQR of this data set, and use it to identify any potential outliers. (Create a boxplot in Excel to see if this lines up with what you got.)  Bottled Water Open the BottledWater file in Excel. This data shows the daily water bottle sales at Queensland Amusement Park and the high temperature for each of 14 summer days. The sales manager believes that daily bottled water sales in the summer are related to the outdoor temperature.   Create a scatter chart showing the relationship between sales and temperature.  Bottled Water (Covariance) Open the BottledWater file again in Excel. Find the sample covariance using the formula COVARIANCE.S(A2:A15, B2:B15).    Bottled Water (Correlation) Open the BottledWater file again in Excel. You can find the correlation coefficient for the sales of bottled water using the formula CORREL(A2:A15, B2:B15).   (A2:A15 defines the range for the variable, and B2:B15 defines the range for the variable.)  Blakely Tires (This is on pg. 64-65 of our textbook.) Open the Excel file TreadWear .  (We will likely not work through this entire example that is in the book. I recommend reading through this on your own.) Blakely Tires is a U.S. producer of automobile tires. In an attempt to learn about the conditions of its tires on automobiles in Texas, the company has obtained information for each of the four tires from 116 automobiles with Blakely brand tires that have been collected through recent state automobile inspection facilities in Texas. The data obtained by Blakely includes the position of the tire on the automobile (left front, left rear, right front, right rear), age of the tire, mileage on the tire, and depth of the remaining tread on the tire. Before Blakely management attempts to learn more about its tires on automobiles in Texas, it wants to assess the quality of these data. The tread depth of a tire is a vertical measurement between the top of the tread rubber to the bottom of the tire’s deepest grooves, and is measured in 32nds of an inch in the United States. New Blakely brand tires have a tread depth of 10\/32nds of an inch, and a tire’s tread depth is considered insufficient if it is 2\/32nds of an inch or less. Shallow tread depth is dangerous as it results in poor traction and so makes steering the automobile more difficult. Blakely’s tires generally last for four to five years or 40,000 to 60,000 miles.  Let's assess the quality of these data by determining which (if any) observations have missing values for any of the variables in the data.   "

We are just going to briefly touch on some ways that ChatGPT can be used for these things.    Using Generative AI to Describe a Data Visualization  Choose (or create) a visualization of data that you want to describe. Use either ChatGPT or Copilot to generate a description of the image. Think about the following questions after generating the description:   (Is the image you used misleading in any way?)    Is the description accurate?    Is there anything notable that the generated description does not mention\/include?    Does the description make sense?    If you aren't sure what image to use, here are some that you can try:                               Using Generative AI to Create Data Visualizations  The analysis we can do and the visualizations we can create often depend on what version of a particular chatbot we are using. Some won't do much analysis with the free versions. (ChatGPT currently has Python incorporated into it and can do some of the analysis\/creating of visualizations using Python, but the free version is limited in what it will do in one day.)  The file below shows the number of Snapchat messages sent per day for a particular user.   Think about what type of chart you would want to use to visualize the data and try to use either ChatGPT or Copilot to create a visualization of the data.

The outcomes of a binomial experiment and the corresponding probabilities of these outcomes are called a binomial distribution .  The probability of exactly successes in trials with probability of success, , is where .  Good news! The mean and standard deviation of a binomial distribution are simple computations:   As the number of trials in a binomial experiment increases, calculating the probabilities required using the complex formula becomes tedious. Therefore, we will compute probabilities using Excel formulas.  In Excel:           The Poisson Distribution    We might want to understand how busy traffic is near campus. Let's say that we stand at the intersection of Clyde Way and Austin Bluffs Parkway and count how many cars drive by on Austin Bluffs from noon-1pm on a particular day. Is this a binomial experiment?      A Poisson process is a probability experiment possessing the following characteristics:     It counts the number of occurrences of an event over a period of time, area, distance, or some other measurement.

  "title": "Continuous Probability Distributions Worksheet",
  "body": " Continuous Probability Distributions Worksheet   Now we will study probability distributions that arise from continuous random variables, which are outcomes that take on any numerical value in an interval, including numbers with decimal points. Recall that probabilities for specific values of a discrete random variable were easy to calculate and the graph of the discrete probability distribution looks like a histogram with a countable number of bars. By contrast, only the probability of a range of values (not a specific value) can be calculated for a continuous random variable. Why?  Since there is an infinite number of possible values for a continuous random variable, the probability of one specific value is theoretically equal to zero!  Let's study four specific continuous probability distributions and identify the types of data where they are useful.    Common Continuous Probability Distributions     Normal Distribution:    Normal Distribution (Made in GeoGebra by the GeoGebra Materials Team)  Link to GeoGebra:          Exponential Distribution:    Exponential Distribution (Made in GeoGebra by DavidK)  Link to GeoGebra:          Uniform Distribution:    Uniform Distribution (Made in GeoGebra by David Ramsay)  Link to GeoGebra:          Triangular Probability Distribution:    Triangular Distribution (Made in Desmos)  Link to Desmos:          Continuous Probability Distribution Matching Problem  Match each probability distribution with the situation in which it is useful.    Normal Distribution   Useful when data tends to fall in the center and extreme values are rare     exponential distribution   Useful when low values for data occur often and high values are rare     uniform distribution   Useful when data of all values have an equal chance of occurring      The Normal Probability Distribution  The mathematical expression that describes the shape of the normal probability distribution is called the normal probability density function:   Despite the complexity of this function, there are only two parameters that completely determine the shape of the distribution: the mean, , and the standard deviation, . Let's take a closer look at how they impact the distribution. (Don't worry -- we won't be using this formula to compute probabilities. We have other tools!)    How does changing the standard deviation ( ) and the mean ( ) change the curve?  Graph of Normal Distribution powered by Desmos           controls the spread of the curve. Larger results in a flatter, more spread out curve     controls the location of the center. Larger shifts the hill of the curve to the right       The first two commands apply to situations where the goal is to compute a probability associated with a data value.   The NORM.DIST( , mean, standard deviation, cumulative) applies to problems involving a normal distribution with a specified mean and standard deviation.    The NORM.S.DIST( , cumulative) applies to problems involving the standard normal distribution ( and ).   (Cumulative = TRUE or FALSE)  What if we want to know the specific that satisfies a given probability? Then we can work backward using the tables ( Standard Normal Table ) and use the -score formula in reverse. If the exact probability cannot be found in the table, then we can use the closest values.  The Excel formulas that apply to this situation are similar to the ones we saw earlier, replacing .DIST with .INV:   NORM.INV(probability, mean, standard deviation) applies to normal distributions with a specified mean and standard deviation    NORM.S.INV(probability) is used for standard normal distributions        The Exponential Probability Distribution   The exponential probability distribution is a continuous distribution commonly used in business to measure the time between customer arrivals or the time between failures in a business process  The mathematical expression that describes the shape of the curve for the exponential probability distribution is called the exponential probability density function:   Recall the we saw in a previous chapter when the discrete Poisson distribution was introduced. It is not a coincidence that we are using in both of these distributions. A discrete random variable that follows a Poisson distribution with a mean equal to has a counterpart continuous random variable that follows the exponential distribution with a mean equal to .  It is easy to confuse the two -- try to remember that is a countable (discrete) rate while is a measurable (continuous) interval.  A small bit of good news: the standard deviation for an exponential distribution is equal to its mean. That is, .   The only parameter in the formula is . Let's look at how it impacts the shape of the distribution.  Exponential Distribution powered by Desmos     Computing Probabilities for the Exponential Distributions  The formula for calculating the probability that a random variable is less than a specified value is: where .  The Excel formula for calculating probabilities for the exponential distribution is where cumulative=TRUE (if you want cumulative probability) or FALSE (if you do not want cumulative probability).   An exponential probability distribution has lambda equal to customers per hour. Find the probability that the next customer will arrive within the next minute. (Round your answer to 4 decimal places.)       Any value in the interval is marked as correct for this problem.      Incorrect. Did you round to four decimal places?  (Here )        The Uniform Distribution   The uniform distribution is a continuous distribution where the probability of any interval is equal to any other interval with the same width.  The mathematical expression that describes the shape of the curve for the uniform probability distribution is called the continuous uniform probability density function:   Uniform Distribution:  Uniform Distribution (Made in GeoGebra by David Ramsay)     Since this function is a constant, the shape of the uniform probability distribution is a rectangle. So computing probabilities associated with it simply involves finding areas of rectangles:    The mean and standard deviation for the uniform distribution are:               (Donnelly 6.34)  Assume the time required to pass through security at a particular airport follows the continuous uniform distribution with a minimum time of 8 minutes and a maximum time of 31 minutes.  Calculate the value of .     What are the mean and standard deviation for this distribution?                 What is the probability that the next passenger will require less than 25 minutes to pass through security?       What is the probability that the next passenger will require more than 23 minutes to pass through security?       What is the probability that the next passenger will require between 13 and 20 minutes to pass through security?       What time represents the 75th percentile of this distribution?    minutes     The Triangular Probability Distribution   The triangular probability distribution is useful when only subjective probability estimates are available. There are many situations for which we do not have sufficient data and only subjective estimates of possible values are available. In the triangular probability distribution, we need only to specify the minimum possible value , the maximum possible value , and the most likely value (or mode) of the distribution . If these values can be knowledgeably estimated for a continuous random variable by a subject-matter expert, then as an approximation of the actual probability density function, we can assume that the triangular distribution applies.    Consider a situation in which a project manager is attempting to estimate the time that will be required to complete an initial assessment of the capital project of constructing a new corporate headquarters. The assessment process includes completing environmental-impact studies, procuring the required permits, and lining up all the contractors and subcontractors needed to complete the project. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the duration of these tasks, and generally little or no historical data are available to help estimate the probability distribution for the time required for this assessment process.  Suppose that we are able to discuss this project with several subject-matter experts who have worked on similar projects. From these expert opinions and our own experience, we estimate that the minimum required time for the initial assessment phase is six months and that the worst-case estimate is that this phase could require 24 months if we are delayed in the permit process or if the results from the environmental-impact studies require additional action. While a time of six months represents a best case and 24 months a worst case, the consensus is that the most likely amount of time required for the initial assessment phase of the project is 12 months. From these estimates, we can use a triangular distribution as an approximation for the probability density function for the time required for the initial assessment phase of constructing a new corporate headquarters.

Hypothesis Testing  We have shown how a sample could be used to develop a point and interval estimates of population parameters such as the mean ( ) and the proportion ( ). Now we will continue the discussion of statistical inference by showing how hypothesis testing can be used to determine whether a statement about the value of a population parameter should or should not be rejected.       A hypothesis is an assumption about a population parameter.    The null hypothesis , denoted , represents the status quo and involves stating the belief that the population parameter is a specific value    The alternative hypothesis , denoted , represents the opposite of , and is believed to be true if the null hypothesis is found to be false.            : No more than of the registered voters in Santa Clara County voted in the primary election.     : More than of the registered voters in Santa Clara County voted in the primary election.

  "body": " Sample Size   Determining the Sample Size  How large a sample is necessary to make an accurate estimate? The answer is not simple, since it depends on three things:   The confidence level    The standard deviation    The margin of error     The more confident we want to be, the wider we want our interval, but there is a tradeoff. If an interval is too wide, it provides little information. On the other hand, a narrow interval requires a larger sample size and sampling can be a costly procedure. Hence, it is handy to be able to be able to calculate ahead of time the sample size required to achieve a specified margin of error. With a bit of algebra on the appropriate margin of error from the confidence interval formula, we can determine the sample size.      The formula when working with a mean is where is the desired margin of error.    Similarly, the formula when working with a proportion is where is the desired margin of error.      If necessary, round the answer up to obtain a whole number. If you round down, then you won't achieve the desired margin of error.   (Donnelly 8.44) Determine the sample size needed to construct a confidence interval to estimate the average GPA for the student population at a college with a margin of error equal to 0.5. Assume the standard deviation of the GPA for the student population is 2.5.  (Donnelly 8.47) A certain region would like to estimate the proportion of voters who intend to participate in upcoming elections. A pilot sample of 50 voters found that 39 of them intended to vote in the election. Determine the additional number of voters that need to be sampled to construct a interval with a margin of error equal to 0.08 to estimate the proportion.  "

As of July 2024, there are many examples of AI chatbots that are commonly used. A few examples are:   ChatGPT    Google Bard    Microsoft Copilot    Jasper     The field of generative AI is constantly changing, and so by the time you read what is written here, it will almost certainly already be outdated.  At the moment, there are many things that generative AI is useful for, and there are things that it cannot do (reliably) quite yet. It is important that we know how to use AI in our work but also understand its current limitations. It is still important for us to have a good understanding of what we are doing so that we are not presenting misleading visualizations or analysis.  For example, here is a YouTube video showing how ChatGPT-4 did not provide correct analysis of a relatively simple data set:   Newer versions of ChatGPT allow us to upload a data file, and the chatbot can use Python behind the scenes to analyze the data. We're going to play around more with what it can currently do in terms of analyzing data and\/or creating visualizations.
