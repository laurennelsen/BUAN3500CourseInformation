  "body": " Course Content and Format   Course Description  This course will provide students with an understanding of how organizations can successfully collect, organize, manipulate, use, prospect and present data. Students will manipulate and interpret actual data using software such as Excel, SPSS, Power BI, Tableau, or Watson.   Prerequisite Information:   Successful completion of QUAN 2020 and Junior standing in the College of Business are required. You are expected to be proficient in Excel – do not expect class time to be devoted to learning Excel basics.    Course Format  The course will meet in person in Dwire Hall 122 (A tentative schedule is included later in the syllabus.) On Canvas, the course is organized by weekly modules.  Based on a background coverage of Descriptive Statistics, Data Visualization, Probability, Statistical Inference, and the philosophy of information presentation, we will use Excel and Tableau to produce data analysis of real-world data samples.  This class may be run more informally than what you might have experienced in QUAN 2010 and 2020. You are now more experienced and mature learners, and our course will focus mostly on projects\/case studies\/writing assignments instead of quizzes and exams. You should do the assigned reading from the schedule below before each class meeting.    Course Learning Objectives     Students will understand the principles and concepts of descriptive statistics in a business context, extending the coverage in QUAN 2010 and QUAN 2020.    Students will develop a philosophy of information presentation, and apply the concepts of descriptive statistics to make effective data displays to support decision making.    Students will apply descriptive analytics tools and software to uncover patterns and relationships in data.    Students will summarize and communicate insights provided by data in a professional business context.      "

If your UCCS email is not your primary address, consider forwarding your UCCS email address to another account you check often. All official course information must be sent through your UCCS account or Canvas.  (We will be meeting in a computer lab, so it's okay if you don't have a personal computer -- you can use a computer in our classroom. But you are still expected to check email\/Canvas regularly.)    Technology Competencies  You are expected to begin this course with basic computing skills that include using Canvas, Microsoft Word, accessing online research databases, and corresponding using your UCCS email.

I strongly recommend asking me for extensions if you find yourself needing them. In general, communicating with me earlier rather than later about your situation makes it more likely that we can make some kind of arrangement appropriate to your situation. Let me know as soon as possible if you are going to miss a quiz or exam. If you don't notify me in advance of your absence, or if you do not have a valid excuse, you may not be allowed to make up the assignment\/assessment, and you may receive a score of zero for that assignment\/assessment.    How to be successful in BUAN 3500     Come to class and pay attention\/be engaged as we're working in class.    Ask for help as soon as you realize you need it!    Come to office hours!    Commit to spending a minimum of 5 hours per week (split among at least 3 different days) to complete and submit the assignments for the course on time.    Form a study group with your classmates and meet regularly to work on the material.    Check UCCS email daily for updates or Canvas announcements regarding the course, and reply to those messages when appropriate.    Regularly review the syllabus\/calendar so you don't miss due dates.    Read\/study the book!    Go to the QUAN tutoring center in Dwire ( ) and\/or the Mathematics Excel Center ( https:\/\/mathcenter.uccs.edu ) for tutoring related to QUAN\/statistics topics       Attendance  It is the expectation of the College of Business that students will attend all classes. However, specific classroom attendance policies are left to the discretion of the instructors. Students are responsible for knowing the attendance policies of their individual instructors. Business instructors may drop students who do not attend the first class of the semester. This policy allows waitlisted students who do attend the first class to be added to the class. Students registering for classes after the first class must obtain approval from the instructor prior to enrolling in the class.  Class attendance is an important part of the educational process in this course. Our class time is valuable, and you’re expected to attend class regularly if you are able (and not sick). Talk to me if you have concerns about this.  The material builds on itself, so I really don’t want you to fall behind. If something comes up, such as illness, that prevents you from attending class, then let me know as soon as possible.

Moreover, in this classroom we will be working in groups for some of the time. It is essential that we all work together to create an environment where everyone is welcome.  In this class, we will work together to develop a learning community that is inclusive and respectful. Our diversity may be reflected by differences in race, culture, age, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic background, and myriad other social identities and life experiences. The goal of inclusiveness, in a diverse community, encourages and appreciates expressions of different ideas, opinions, and beliefs, so that conversations and interactions that could potentially be divisive turn instead into opportunities for intellectual and personal enrichment. A dedication to inclusiveness requires respecting what others say, their right to say it, and the thoughtful consideration of others' communication. Both speaking up and listening are valuable tools for furthering thoughtful, enlightening dialogue. Respecting one another's individual differences is critical in transforming a collection of diverse individuals into an inclusive, collaborative and excellent learning community. Our core commitment shapes our core expectation for behavior inside and outside of the classroom.  "

They will work with you to determine what accommodations are appropriate for your situation. To avoid any delay, you should contact Disability Services as soon as possible. Please note that accommodations are not retroactive and disability accommodations cannot be provided until a Faculty Accommodation Letter has been given to me. Please contact Disability Services for more information: Main Hall room 105, 719-255-3354 or dservice@uccs.edu.    Religious Accommodations  If due to religious obligations you plan to request adjustments with scheduled exams, assignments or required attendance in this class, please contact me as soon as possible. I will work with you and university counsel’s office to ensure a reasonable accommodation is made.    Military and Veteran Students  Military students who have the potential to participate in military activities including training and deployment should consult with faculty prior to registration for any course, but no later than the end of the first week of classes. For more information, visit the Office of Veteran and Military Student Affairs .  At this time, the student should provide the instructor with a schedule of planned absences, preferably signed by the student's commander, to allow the instructor to evaluate and advise the student on the possible impact of the absences. In this course, the instructor will consider absences due to participation in verified military activities to be excused absences, on par with those due to other unavoidable circumstances such as illness. If, however, it appears that military obligations will prevent adequate attendance or performance in the course, the instructor may advise the student to register for the course at another time, when they are more likely to be successful.

  "body": " Course and Institutional Policies   UCCS Student Code of Conduct and Professionalism  The purpose of the Student Code of Conduct is to maintain the general welfare of the university community. The university strives to make the campus community a place of study, work, and residence where people are treated, and treat one another, with respect and civility. This course covers material that could generate strong opinions or emotions. Consider the Daniels Fund Ethics Initiative Principles: Integrity, Trust, Accountability, Transparency, Fairness, Respect, Rule of Law, and Viability, when considering conduct during the course. Learn more at the Daniels Fund Ethics Initiative at UCCS website .    Academic Integrity and Plagiarism  The College of Business follows and enforces the student conduct rules and policies that are set forth by the university and are listed in the Student Rights and Responsibilities section of the Academic Catalog.  Students caught engaging in academic dishonesty may receive a zero on the assignment in question, an \"F\" in the class, or be suspended from the College of Business and\/or university. This includes, but is not limited to, plagiarism (copying others’ work as your own—in part or in total—without the proper citations) and\/or the use of artificial intelligence to write or contribute to assignments without instructor approval.    Generative AI  Given that anything generated by AI has been culled from the web and restated or recreated without attribution (and sometimes even with false attribution), that content could be considered as to have been plagiarized.  The use of generative AI tools is permitted in this course for the following activities:   Brainstorming and refining your ideas    Fine tuning your research questions    Finding information on your topic    Drafting an outline to organize your thoughts    Checking grammar and style     The use of generative AI tools is not permitted in this course for the following activities:   Impersonating you in classroom contexts, such as by using the tool to compose discussion board replies or content that you put into a Teams or Zoom chat    Completing group work that your group has assigned to you, unless it is mutually agreed upon that you may utilize the tool    Writing a draft of a writing assignment    Writing entire sentences, paragraphs, or papers to complete class assignments       Copyright Statement  Unless otherwise noted, all materials contained in this course, including slide and video presentations, exams, study guides, outlines, and similar materials, are protected by copyright laws and university policy.  You may download and\/or make copies of course materials for personal use only. You may not reproduce, distribute, upload, display, or share any course materials, in whole or in part, without my express written consent. Unauthorized distribution of these materials to any website, either during or after the semester, is strictly prohibited.    Privacy Statement  Assuring privacy among faculty and students engaged in online and face-to-face instructional activities helps promote open and robust conversations and mitigates concerns that comments made within the context of the class will be shared beyond the classroom. As such, recordings of instructional activities occurring in online or face-to-face classes may be used solely for internal class purposes by the faculty member and students registered for the course, and only during the period in which the course is offered. Students will be informed of such recordings by a statement in the syllabus for the course in which they will be recorded. Instructors who wish to make subsequent use of recordings that include student activity may do so only with informed written consent of the students involved or if all student activity is removed from the recording. Recordings including student activity that have been initiated by the instructor may be retained by the instructor only for individual use.    Responsible Reporting: Institutional Equity\/Title IX Statement  The Office of Institutional Equity (OIE), administers the University of Colorado (CU) Sexual Misconduct policy (including Title IX), the UCCS Discrimination and Harassment Policy, and the CU Conflict of Interest in Cases of Amorous Relationships Policy. All UCCS faculty and staff, including student employees, are considered “responsible employees” and must report any suspected or known conduct that may be in violation of these policies (“prohibited conduct”) directly to the OIE. This reporting requirement exists to support the safety of our campus community, and there is no statute of limitations. Prohibited conduct includes unwanted verbal or physical conduct that is sexual in nature, or based on a protected class (such as, gender, race, veteran status, disability, etc.). You may review the Applicable Policies and OIE's Resolution Procedures here . While reporting prohibited conduct to the OIE is required by UCCS employees, participation in an OIE resolution process through the OIE is voluntary. Confidential reporting, and access to medical and mental health services, are available to students through the UCCS Wellness Center at 719-255-4444.    Diversity Statement  UCCS considers the diversity of its students, faculty, and staff to be a strength and critical to its educational mission. UCCS expects every member of the university community to contribute to an inclusive and respectful culture for all in its classrooms, work environments, and at campus events. For more information on resources related to diversity and inclusion, please visit the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion .    Withdrawal from Course  You may choose to withdraw from your class. Please note the last date for withdrawal without instructor\/dean's approval is October 27, 2023. Please email me prior to your withdrawal as I would like to discuss your progress in this course prior to withdrawal decisions.   "
