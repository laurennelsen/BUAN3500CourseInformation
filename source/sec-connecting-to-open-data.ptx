<title>City of Denver Checkbook OData Example</title>


  <p>
    Go to the link below to see information about the <q>City of Denver Checkbook</q> dataset on the Colorado Information Marketplace.
    </p>
    <p>
    <url href="https://data.colorado.gov/Business/City-of-Denver-Checkbook/wnau-xrqi/about_data" />
  </p>

  <p>
    We could export the dataset as a csv or Excel file, but instead we're going to access the data via <em>oData</em>.
  </p>

  <note>
    <q>OData</q> stands for <q>Open Data Protocol</q>.  (OData is an ISO/IEC approved, OASIS standard that defines a set of best practices for building and consuming REST APIs (API stands for <q>Application Programming Interface</q>).
  </note>

  <p>
   We're going to connect Tableau to this OData data source.  (We're working with open data so we don't need authentication.)
  </p>

  <p>
    (Note:  Tableau Desktop only supports extracts for OData.)
  </p>

  <p>
    After connecting to the data, create a dashboard using the dataset.
