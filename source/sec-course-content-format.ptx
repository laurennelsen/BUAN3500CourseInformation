    <p>
        The course will meet in person in Dwire Hall 122 (A tentative schedule is included later in the syllabus.)  On Canvas, the course is organized by weekly modules. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Based on a background coverage of Descriptive Statistics, Data Visualization, Probability, Statistical Inference, and the philosophy of information presentation, we will use Excel and Tableau to produce data analysis of real-world data samples.

        </p>

        <p>
        This class may be run more informally than what you might have experienced in QUAN 2010 and 2020.  You are now more experienced and mature learners, and our course will focus mostly on projects/case studies/writing assignments instead of quizzes and exams.  You should do the assigned reading from the schedule below before each class meeting.
